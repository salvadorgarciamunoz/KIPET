Code Documentation
******************

All of the public classes and methods used in KIPET are listed on these pages.

Users should generally only be interested in the modules and classes found in **Main modules**.

Developers may find the other modules and classes of interest.

Main modules
============

The two modules that will actually be used by the user are found here. They are initialized automatically
and can be imported directly from "kipet".

Estimator Tools
=================

The main estimation modules and classes are found here alongside several helper modules.
The core methods for variance estimation and parameter fitting (VarianceEstimator and ParameterEstimator classes)
are found here.

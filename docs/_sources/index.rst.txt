Kinetic Parameter Estimation Toolbox (KIPET)
********************************************

KIPET is the one-stop shop for kinetic parameter estimation from batch and fed-batch reactor systems using spectroscopic or concentration data. KIPET is a Python-based package using maximum-likelihood statistics, large-scale nonlinear programming optimization, and finite element discretization in a unified framework to solve a variety of parameter estimation problems. Use KIPET to:

* Simulate reactive system described with DAEs  
* Solve DAE systems with collocation methods
* Pre-process data
* Perform estimability analysis
* Estimate data variances
* Estimate kinetic parameters
* Estimate confidence intervals of the estimated parameters
* Estimate parameters from multiple datasets with different experimental conditions
* Obtain the most informative wavelength set to obtain minimal lack-of-fit
* Analyze your system (SVD, PCA, lack of fit, etc.)
* Visualize results

KIPET makes use of Pyomo as the algebraic modeling language and much of the syntax can be found here:
